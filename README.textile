h1. Cucumber Cocktails

Some useful tasks and formatters that I use with Cucumber.

h2. Formatters

* InProgress - Mirrors the progress formatter but records any scenarios which passed and reports them in the summary. Intended for use with in-progress feature stream where passing scenarios are failures.
  
h2. Rake tasks

* Running two streams of features: in-progress and finished.
